# Rice Cooker Porridge

Cooking porridge in the microwave is lame. Try it in the rice cooker, you'll get a much nicer result.

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup rolled oats
- 1 cup water or milk

## Method
- Place rolled oats and water/milk in rice cooker
- Turn the rice cooker on
- Stir occasionally until the porridge has reached a nice consistency
- Serve!

## Fun Stuff
- Try coconut milk instead of blue top
- Add almonds and honey (pro-tip, EDA keeps a stash of free honey)
- Brown sugar and banana is also a classic topping
