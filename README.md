Inspiration for sandwich-press/grill/rice-cooker/microwave cuisine

Why?
- Cheap
- Fun
- Can stay within a comfortable 20m of your machine
- Healthy

How?
- However you want. Do not feel obliged to stick appliances listed below
- Sandwich press - a favourite. has a raised lip, you can get a little bit saucy here
- Grill - makes those great lines in food. also will remove fat, if that's your thing
- Mega toaster - toasts four slices of whatever you want
- Dual Microwaves - talk to greg (hihi) before trying to cook eggs
- Rice cooker - no not be fooled, it won't turn off when the rice is cooked. also good for soups & risottoey things

I'm only hosting this repo until it gets picked up by EDA!
